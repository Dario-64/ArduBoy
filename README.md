# ArduBoy

🕹️ **ArduBoy** is my own custom-built game console, created from scratch using Arduino-compatible hardware.  
**Note:** This project is not affiliated with or based on the official [ArduBoy](https://www.arduboy.com/) platform — it just shares the name.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This repository is currently a placeholder.  
I’m actively working on the hardware and software, and I’ll upload the source code and documentation once the project is complete.
